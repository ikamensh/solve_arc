# solve_arc

This repository is primarily a demo of using [`arc-py`](https://github.com/ikamensh/arc-py) package to streamline development of agents to tackle [ARC challenge](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC).

Approach: I am hard-coding priors like objectness and then solve manually the tasks in the train set. 
Currently I just score these hand-coded solutions on demo examples, and use whatever performs best.
